    ## Fields and algebraic algebras
    
    === "a)"
        Let $A$ be
    
        - an integral domain
        - and algebraic over K
    
        $\implies A$ is a field.

    === "b)"
        Let A be field, and a sub-algebra of an affine domain $A \subseteq L$. </br>
        $\implies A$ is algebraic.
