# Lemma 1.1

## Fields and algebraic algebras

???+ lemma "Lemma 1.1 a)"
    === "Lemma"
        Let $A$ be
    
        - an integral domain
        - and algebraic over K
    
        $\implies A$ is a field.
    
    === "Proof"
        Trust me bro


???+ lemma "Lemma 1.1 b)"
    === "Lemma"
        Let A be field, and a sub-algebra of an affine domain $A \subseteq L$. </br>
        $\implies A$ is algebraic.

    === "Proof"
        Don't you believe me?
