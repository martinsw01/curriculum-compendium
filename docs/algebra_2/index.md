# Algebra 2 - Commutative Algebra

## Intended learning outcomes

At the end of the module students understand basic concepts of commutative algebra and their
relation to the theory of affine varieties. They are able to apply the learned theorems and
methods to particular problems concerning rings, in particular finitely generated algebras
over a field, and translate them into results on the corresponding affine varieties.

## Content
