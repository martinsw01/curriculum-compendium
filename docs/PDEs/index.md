# Partial Differential Equations

The lectures will be an introduction to the theory of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
They will cover the following topics: classical solutions to Laplace, heat and wave equations, first order PDEs,
Sobolev spaces, weak solutions to second order elliptic PDEs.
