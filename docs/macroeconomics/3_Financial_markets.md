# 3 Financial markets

## Demand for money

Assume that we only have the following two forms of financial investments:

1. Money
2. Obligations

How much should we invest in each? The cost of

- money is not getting interest
- obligations is the transaction cost of sales of obligations

The demand for money ($M^d$) can be given by

$$M^d = Y \cdot L(i)$$

where $Y$ is the income and $i$ is the nominal interest rate. With higher interest rates, the demand for money decreases, so we have $\frac{\partial L}{\partial i} < 0$.


## Supply of money

Assume further that the central bank is the only supplier of money. For the money market to be in equilibrium, the supply of money ($M^s$) must equal the demand for money:

$$M^s = M^d = Y \cdot L(i)$$


## Marked operations

The central bank adjusts the money supply by buying and selling obligations.

- **Expansionary policy**: The central bank increases the supply by buying obligations from private sector.
- **Contractionary policy**: The central bank decreases the supply by selling obligations.


### Effect on the interest rate

<!-- Expansionary policy increases the money supply by buying obligations with money. This increases the demand for obligations, increasing the price and decreasing the interest rate. -->

If the central bank chooses to lower the rate, it must buy obligations to meet the increased demand for money.

If the central bank chooses buy fewer obligations, it must increase the rate to meet the decreased demand for money.
