# 4 IS-LM model

We once again assume a closed economy with the market and financial market in a common model and look at the effects of the financial and monetary policy on the economy.

## IS curve

We have seen the interaction between income, demand and supply when the investments are exogenous. Now, assume the investments to depend on the follwoing two factors:

1. Higher investments yields higher investments:
    - expand production capacity
    - increase equity
2. Higher interest rates yields lower investments:
    - more expensive to borrow money

So, we have the following:

$$I = I(Y, i), \quad \frac{\partial I}{\partial Y} > 0, \quad \frac{\partial I}{\partial i} < 0$$

Now, the marked can be represented by the following equations:

$$
\begin{align}
    Y &= C + I + G \\
    C &= C(Y-T) \\
    I &= I(Y, i)
\end{align}
$$

This yields the **IS curve**,

$$Y = C(Y-T) + I(Y, i) + G$$

which is a relation between the rent $i$ and the production $Y$. What happens when we change the rent? Assuming $C'(Y-T) + \frac{\partial I}{\partial Y}|_i < 0$, we get

$$\frac{\partial Y}{\partial i} = \frac{\left.\frac{\partial I}{\partial i}\right|_Y}{1 - C'(Y-T) - \left.\frac{\partial I}{\partial Y}\right|_i} < 0$$

so the production decreases when the rent increases. This in turn decreases income and investments, shifting the IS curve to the left. This effect increases the more

- sensitive the investments are to the rent and production
- and how much the marginal propensity to consume is.
