# Exercise Sheet 1

We are given the model

$$
\begin{align}
    Y &= C + I + G \\
    C &= c_0 + c_1 (Y - T) \\
    I &= b_0 + b_1 Y \\
\end{align}
$$

where $b_0, b_1, c_0, c_1 > 0$ are positive constants.

**a.** The sentral assumptions in the model are

1. The economy is closed
2. Homogenous goods
3. Static model
4. No changes in storage (all goods are consumed)
5. Constant prices

**b.**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| $Y$      | Total production |
| $C$      | Private consumption |
| $I$      | Investments |
| $G$      | Government consumption |
| $T$      | Taxes minus transfers |
| $c_0$    | Autonomous consumption |
| $c_1$    | Marginal propensity to consume |
| $b_0$    | Autonomous investments |
| $b_1$    | Marginal propensity to invest |

Endogenous variables: $Y, C, I$

Exogenous variables: $G, T$

Exogenous parameters: $c_0, c_1, b_0, b_1$

The equations are fully determined, as we have three independent equations and three endogenous variables.

**c.**

Inserting $C$ and $I$ into the formula for $Y$ gives

$$
\begin{align}
    Y &= c_0 + c_1 (Y - T) + b_0 + b_1 Y + G \\
    &= \frac{1}{1-c_1-b_1}(c_0 - c_1 T + b_0 + G)
\end{align}
$$

**d.**

For the model to make any sense, we need the sum of the marginal propensity to consume and invest $c_1 + b_1$ to be less than 1, as negative production does not make sense.

**e.**

The effect of increased government spending $G$ on

- total production $Y$: Increases
- private consumption $C$: Increases
- investments $I$: Increases
