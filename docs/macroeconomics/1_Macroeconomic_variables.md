# 1 Macroeconomic variables

## National income accounting

The national income accounting is prepared by Statistisk sentralbyr√• (SSB) and is a key tool foreconomic analysis and forming economic politics. It build upon a socioeconomic cycle, which assumes that the gross domestic product (GDP) is measurable as a total income and total expenditure. GDP is a measure of the valiue added through production of goods and services over a period of time, for example a year.

### GDP

The gross product ofa company is the value of their goods and services minus product effort. Summing over all companies and buisnesses, we get the nations gross product (GDP). It includes

- products aimed at the market
- products not traded on the market (teaching, health care, ploice, etc.)

On the other hand, it does not include unpaind work at home.


### Fixed vs. current prices

Increased GDP can be due to increased prices and/or increased production. We therefore separate between

- Nominal GDP: GDP at current prices
- Real GDP: GDP at fixed prices

The variablesin the national income accounting aremeasured in both to findout how large the real changes in volume are and how much of the change is due to inflation. For this,we use priceindices:

- Konsumprisindeksen (KPI): Includes the products the "average" consumer buys, and shows how much the prices on average changes month to month.
- GDP deflator: Shows how much the average price changes when all sectors in the BNP are included.

    | Year | Quantity of Cars | Price of Cars | Nominal GDP | Real GDP (in 2012 dollars) |
    |------|------------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------------|
    | 2011 | 10               | $20,000       | $200,000    | $240,000                   |
    | 2012 | 12               | $24,000       | $288,000    | $288,000                   |
    | 2013 | 13               | $26,000       | $338,000    | $312,000                   |


### GDP as a measure of value added

There are some limitations to GDP as a measure of value added:

- How do we measure the value added by public sector? Is the GDP cerated by welfare, education, etc. correctly measured?
- Unpaidwork at home and volunteer work is not included in GDP, but may have a significant value in some countries.
- A high GDP can mean that there is a lot of pollution, implying that the GDP overestimates the value added. Such damage is difficult to measure.


### GDP per capita as a measure of prosperity

GDP per capita may notbe a good measure of prosperity. However, it is an indication of the possibilities of wealth. There are some difficulties with GDP per capita as a measure of prosperity:

- GDP says nothing about the distribution of wealth
- Wealth depends on consumption and leisure time, not just income
- Health, education, crime, democracy, etc. are also important

Therefore, one should also adjust GDP per capita for purchasing power. In other words, take into account the price level, the purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted GDP per capita.


## The General budget equation

Consider the variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| $Y$      | **GDP**         |
| $IM$     | **Imports**: The value of goods and services the country buys from abroad (cars, computer- and telecom equipment, etc) |
| $C$      | **Private consumption**: The value of goods and services the country's households buy |
| $I$      | **Gross investment in real capital**: Investments in real capital, such as buildings, machines, ships, and transport vehicles, roads, without deduction of capital wear (depreciation) |
| $G$      | **Government consumption/investment**: Defined as for $C$ and $I$, but the public sector (state and municipalities) is the actor, not private |
| $X$      | **Exports**: The value of goods and services the country sells to other countries (fish, oil and gas, metals, postal and telecom services, etc) |


Then, we have the total access to goods and services

$$Y + IM$$

and the application of these:

$$C + I + G + X$$

All the goods and services produced in the country are applied somehow, either as private consumption, investment, government consumption/investment, or exports. Therefore, we have

$$Y + IM = C + I + G + X$$

and we get

$$Y = C + I + G + NX$$

where $NX = X - IM$ is the net exports.

## Unemployment rate

The unemployment rate is an important indicator of a country's macroeconomic situation. Unemployment is defined as the number of people who are looking for a job, but do not have one. The labor force ($L$) is the sum of the employed ($N$) and the unemployed ($U$). The unemployment rate is then given by

$$u = \frac{U}{L}$$

## Inflation

Inflation is a continuous increase in the general price level. The opposite is deflation. This is an impoertant value in macroeconomics, as inflation

- can affect the distribution of wealth and 
- lead to uncertainty

Most macroeconomists agree that a moderate and stable inflation around 1-4% is best. In Norway, the inflation target is 2%.

### Measuring inflation

**GDP deflator**

The GDP deflator is given by

$$P_t = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}_t}{\text{Real GDP}_t} = \frac{Y_t^n}{Y_t^r}.$$

This  gives an inflation rate based on the GDP deflator:

$$\pi_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$$

**The consumer price index (CPI)**

The volume of goods that is produced in an econom may not be the same as the volume of goods that is consumed by households. The CPI measures (a weighted average of) the price level on a representative collection of consumer goods. It gives a specific list of goods and services over time, which is meant to represent the consumer trend of a typical household.
