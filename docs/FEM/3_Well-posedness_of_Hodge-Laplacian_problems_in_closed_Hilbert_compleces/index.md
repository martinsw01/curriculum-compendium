# 3 Well-posedness of Hodge-Laplacian problems in closed Hilbert complexes

The poisson equation is elliptic (involves a coercive bilinear form) and its well-posedness
(an dstability analysis of its FEM approximation) follows from the Lax-Milgram lemma.

The static Maxwell problem is not coercive and its well-posedness relies on more involved
properties ($\inf$-$\sup$ conditions, $T$-coercivity).
